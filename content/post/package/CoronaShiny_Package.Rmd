# Package 

In this blog I will be talking about packages, what do they entail and what is a good package like and then we will be reviewing a package made by a colleague of mine. The name of the package is CoronaShiny.  The author of the Package is [Vinny Vu](https://github.com/vvuu0009).  You can check it out on [git](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-vvuu0009). The package is wrapped around the coronavirus pandemic and has an inbuilt shiny-app inside the package. We will discuss what the package entails a bit later on.



##  What did I think this package would do? Did it do it?

The idea I got for what the package contains and what I can use from it, is that the package contains an app helping users interact and get visualizations on the cumulative cases of corona-virus in each continent. The package has been designed to launch the app with the *launch_app()* function. Also, the package has an inbuilt function of *selectInput01*, the function helps the user to update the app inputs directly from the function instead of indulging in a lengthy process of customized coding for each input. This is what I understood from reading the README file on the git repository. 

Using the package CoronaShiny, provided as promised. It is simple to use with no complications which make any package desirable to use. 

# About the APP
