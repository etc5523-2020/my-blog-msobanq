<h1>DATA Description</h1>
<p>The data set is for the Covid-19 virus affecting all the countries, categorising the cases into confirmed cases, recovered cases and cases that resulted in death. The data set has a lot of limited variables. The data is collected from this link <a href="https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus">here</a>. Our primary focus for the effected country will be Pakistan. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="RamiKrispin"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<div id="why-pakistan" class="section level2">
<h2>Why Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. It is the world’s fifth-most populous country with a population exceeding 212.2 million. It is the 33rd-largest country by area, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles).</p>
<p>As the worlds 5th largest populated country, the government of Pakistan had a very different approach in how to handle, and contain the virus.</p>
<p>First the government was hesitent in imposing the lockdown. As reported by this article <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/11/on-coronavirus-pakistans-government-is-missing-in-action/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then the government with pressure from the opposition international community and the people imposed the lockdown as described in <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/pakistan-smart-lockdown-imposed-across-cities-of-pakistan-as-covid-19-cases-grow-rapidly/">this</a> article.</p>
<p>Here are some important dates according <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Pakistan#:~:text=Sindh%20has%20recorded%20the%20most,lockdown%20was%20eased%20in%20phases">this</a> source.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>We will start by filtering the loaded data, the country we want is Pakistan, so we will be filtering that. The first case in Pakistan was reported in February, so let’s get rid of additional dates. Some variables will be taken out, the province variable is empty, coordinates like latitude and longitude make no sense as all the recorded cases are from the same coordinates.</p>
<p>With the lockdown lifted during important events there were a lot of reservations.
Some important dates are</p>
<p>13th of March (lockdown imposed)</p>
<p>27th of March (Eid-ul-Fitr, a one day religious festival)</p>
<p>24th of May (Smart lockdown imposed, only affected areas under lockdown)</p>
<p>31st of July (Eid-ul-Adha, a three day religions festival)</p>
<p>8th of August (lockdown lifted)</p>
<p>14th of August (Independence Day)</p>

<p>The table is interactive, for users to do their own research with respect to day, month, week of the year, number of cases reported, deaths reported, patients recovered. To identify the surge in numbers, especially after the above mentioned dates.</p>
