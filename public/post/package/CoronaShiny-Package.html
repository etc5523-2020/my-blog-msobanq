<h1>Package</h1>
<p>In this blog I will be talking about packages, what do they entail and what is a good package like and then we will be reviewing a package made by a colleague of mine. The name of the package is CoronaShiny. The author of the Package is <a href="https://github.com/vvuu0009">Vinny Vu</a>. You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-vvuu0009">git</a>. The package is wrapped around the corona virus pandemic and has an inbuilt shiny-app inside the package. We will discuss what the package entails a bit later on.</p>
<div id="what-did-i-think-this-package-would-do-did-it-do-it" class="section level2">
<h2>What did I think this package would do? Did it do it?</h2>
<p>The idea I got for what the package contains and what I can use from it, is that the package contains an app helping users interact and get visulaizations on the cumulative cases of corona-virus in each continant.</p>
